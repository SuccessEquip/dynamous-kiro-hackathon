# Spec-Docs Template System

A comprehensive template system for creating structured project specifications that align workflows and guide development.

## Overview

This template system provides a structured approach to documenting projects through interconnected documents:

- **Spec Template** - Main project specification and overview
- **Design Template** - Technical design and architecture decisions  
- **Requirements Template** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- **Tasks Template** - Implementation breakdown and workflow guidance

## Usage

1. Copy the relevant templates to your project
2. Rename them to match your project (e.g., `user-auth-spec.md`)
3. Fill out each template following the provided structure
4. Cross-reference between documents using the suggested linking patterns
5. Use as living documents that evolve with your project

## Template Structure

### Spec Template (`spec-template.md`)
The main project specification that provides high-level overview and connects to other documents.

### Design Template (`design-template.md`) 
Technical architecture, system design, and implementation approach.

### Requirements Template (`requirements-template.md`)
Detailed functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and constraints.

### Tasks Template (`tasks-template.md`)
Implementation breakdown, workflow steps, and development guidance.

## Workflow Alignment

These templates are designed to:
- Ensure all stakeholders have shared understanding
- Provide clear implementation guidance
- Enable iterative development with feedback loops
- Maintain project alignment throughout development
- Support both waterfall and agile methodologies

## Best Practices

- Keep documents concise but comprehensive
- Update templates as project evolves
- Use cross-references to maintain consistency
- Include examples and code snippets where helpful
- Review and validate with team before implementation

## Getting Started

1. Start with the spec template for project overview
2. Create design document for technical approach
3. Detail requirements for implementation clarity
4. Break down into tasks for execution planning

Each template includes detailed instructions and examples to guide you through the process.
